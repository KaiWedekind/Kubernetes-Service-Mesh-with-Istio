# Kubernetes Service Meshes with Istio

Building microservice architectures is complex. Handling the involved complexities, like circuit breaking, rate limiting, observability or security, is usually left up to the development teams to implement. Using well known open source frameworks is an option, but this will quickly lead to excessive library bloat and suddenly your services are not quite so micro anymore. So you better put your microservice architectures on a service mesh diet! 

This course provides practical hands-on experience on using the Istio service mesh. Instead of implementing cross cutting concerns within each service, you will see how a service mesh allows you to transparently inject and decorate the desired concerns into the individual communication channels.You will discuss the conceptual Istio architecture with its main building blocks and workings you need to know. The individual sections will then demonstrate how to install Istio and use its traffic management, resilience, diagnosability and security features. 

By the end of this course you will be ready to deploy Istio in production to deploy and run your next cloud native microservice architecture.
